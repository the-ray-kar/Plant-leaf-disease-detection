## Plant leaf disease detection

This project is an implementation of a research paper
Following are steps
1. Image smoothening and enhancement

4. Image clustering based on genetic algorithm

6. Image feature extraction using co-occurence matrix : contrast, entropy, homogenity, etc
7. Classification using KNN and SVM
